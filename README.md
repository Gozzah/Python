# Eksamensprojekt

Our group has decided to go into combat with geographical plotting.
We would like to try and map the entire worlds GDP on an Earth map.
The user should be able to rotate the map. To do so, we plan on using Choropleth maps since we have just recently discovered them and find them quite amazing and confusing.
Each country should have its own color depending on their GDP, to obtain that we think about using Plotly and some kind of Index-bar related to GDP amount. Plotly will be used for basic charts as well.

We plan to expand on the idea as we go along.
